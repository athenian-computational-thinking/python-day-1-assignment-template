# Welcome to Python!

This is your first repository (repo for short). The README.md is a document that contains useful information about the assignment. Be sure to read the README every time you launch a new assignment and refer to it as you work.

It is written in a text-formatting language called Markdown (thus the .md extension). Markdown is an easy formatting language - if you are interested in learning more, let me know.)

## Assignment
For day 1, your task is to practice what we do in class. Essentially these are your notes, which you will submit at the end of class.

* Practice using the syntax we discuss in class
* Save your work in GitHub at the end


## Saving notes
To save:
* Commit
  * Be sure to use a useful commit message
* Push back to GitHub
* Always commit and push as you work and especially before you stop working on something for a while. This keeps track of changes and avoids conflicting versions. 
  * If you ever see errors about version conflicts, let Megan know ASAP!
